# node-GameDig - Project Zomboid Setup

**node-GameDig** is a game server query Node.js module (as well as a [command line executable](#usage-from-command-line)), 
capable of querying for the status of nearly any game or voice server.

If a server makes its status publically available, GameDig can fetch it for you.

Support is available on the [GameDig Discord](https://discord.gg/NVCMn3tnxH) (for questions), or [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/gamedig/node-gamedig/issues) (for bugs).

## Games List
**node-GameDig** can query over 280 games (+ a few services)!  
See the [GAMES_LIST.md](GAMES_LIST.md) file for the currently supported titles, not yet supported ones and notes about some of them.
